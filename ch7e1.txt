Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of an array-based implementation of the ADT stack as compared to a link-based implementation

Array-Based Implementation:

Pros:
- Easy to implement (compiler provides constructors/destructors).
- Best for fixed-size stacks.

Cons:
- Wastes memory if the array is too large.
- Resizing the array takes time if the stack grows.

Link-Based Implementation:

Pros:
- Allows dynamic resizing without performance issues.
- No need to allocate excess memory upfront.

Cons:
- Requires manual memory management (no automatic copy constructor/destructor).
